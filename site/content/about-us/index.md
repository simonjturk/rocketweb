## Our Story
Located in beautiful Hobart, Tasmania, RockitWeb is the realised dream of founder Simon Turk.  Maybe it was the Tassie air, or simply a moment of ~~madness~~ inspiration RockitWeb was born to raise the bar in web development.
> After 20+ years working in technology, from small software companies to large financial corporations (and loads in between), I felt the time was right to put up or shut up.  I want RockitWeb to be the company I wish I could have worked with/for throughout my career. Great technology skills, of course, but supported by honesty, transparency, integrity.  

### Honesty
From our very first talk we will always be honest, clear, and upfront with you.  Life's too short, and your business too important, to worry about reading between the lines and worrying about what's not being said.

### Transparency
RockitWeb will not keep secrets from you. We use all the best tools tools, methodologies, frameworks etc, but sometimes things happen - no one and no project is perfect - and when they do we will keep you in the loop in a clear and easy to understand way.

### Integrity
We want your business, for sure, but we're not going to do anything to get it.  

## Jamstack
If you don't know what the Jamstack is don't worry, you don't have to, but just know that is a new modern way to build websites that has amazing benefits for you and your clients:

### Performance
We're not saying sites not built using the Jamstack can't be fast, of course they can, and many are, but it is harder and takes a lot more effort.  RockitWeb sites/apps are fast by default. We barely have to try.

### Simplicty
We start at simple and then add complexity, not the other way around.
